Hello fellow Earthling,

Aim of <span class="bold green">Prakriti</span> is to make Earth a better place to live in by connecting its people to Nature. Using traditional Indian scientific knowledge, that has been existent for thousands of years but left ignored, in various aspects of life we aspire to bring forth the power of nature as well as help make our environment pristine.

<span class="bold green">Prakriti</span> is an initiative by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/parag.gour.7">Parag Gour</a>, a young environmental engineer from DTU.
