A few changes in your life (eating, sitting and thinking habits) can make you healthy and fit. You can make yourselves less dependent on medicines and more confident on yourselves. And your healthy life is necessary for a healthy environment. _Swasth_ means he who is satisfied in his inner conscience and who is well and in good state. So follow these rules for a healthy mind and body :

- **Wake up before sunrise** (at least half an hour before sunrise). This time is perfect to detoxify yourselves through your daily routine. Use a traditional Indian toilet to freshen up and then clean your teeth with a toothpowder(_manjan_). Use brush twice or thrice a week.
- Get ready for some sweating exercise. If you really can't do _Yog_, you should run/jog for at least 5 km a day. Gradually increase your stamina and workout from 2-8 km a day. For _Yogis_ they should practice _kapalbhati_(half an hr.), _anulom-vilom_(1 hr.), _bhastrika_(5mins), _udgeet_, _bhramri_, at least 12 _asans_ and _dhyan_. Increase your time for each _pranayaam_ gradually under a good teacher. This workout will digest your undigested food and fat. It detoxifies your body through sweat and breathing patterns.
- **Don't use soaps and shampoos for bathing**. Use _lassi_, _multani mitti_, a body scrubber, milk, lemon juice in your bathing water, _besan_ as body cleaner. Use _reetha_, _amla_ juice, _lassi_, _gomutra_ to clean your hair.
- **Have your breakfast before 8 am, lunch between 10am-12pm and dinner before 8 pm**. At these timings your body's digestive system is active and so your food is digested properly.
- Always **drink some water with your meals** and there's a proper way to do that. Eat 2-3 bites of food and then take a sip of water(not cold but can be warm in winters) and then again have 2-3 bits of food and then again sip water. In this way you should drink 250ml-400ml of water. This promotes digestion. You can add ginger, garlic, onion, lemon or a pinch of black salt to this water for a healthy body metabolism. This habit of drinking water between meals will reduce your diseases to a great extent.
- **Take time to eat your meals**. Don't just swallow. Chew it well until it forms a liquid. Ideally you should take 30 to 45 mins to have your meal. After all eating is for living.
- **Drink 4 litres of water daily**. You should take 250ml of water at a time. Have a glass of water after 1.5 hours of having your meal or 40 mins before it and in between as said before.
- Your daily antibiotics, antiviral, antibacterial dose comes from **onion, garlic and ginger**. Use it in salad or make _chutney_ or add its juice in water while having your meals. People generally fry these three which is a wrong way to consume it. When taken raw it helps in curing all diseases. Even cancer!
- Check out your _rotis_. **Don't just use wheat to make _roti_**. Add _jowar_, barley(_jau_), _bajra_, _til_, _moong_ , _chana_, _ajwayan_ etc. to it. Multi-grain _atta_ cures mineral deficiency and improves digestion. Never sieve this _atta_ and always grind these grains a bit coarser than usual fine texture.
- The **outer covering (_chilka_ and _choker_) has the most vital nutrients**. It helps in digesting the inner part of that grain or vegetable/fruits so don't sieve your _atta_ to keep intact the _choker_. Also avoid peeling radish, carrots, bitter gourd, cucumber etc.
- Avoid these: refined oil, iodised/refined salt, mill made white-sugar, fine _atta_, sleeping late at night, sleeping for more than 6-8 hrs, allopathic medicines, drinking/eating while standing, unnecessary thinking, mineral oils for hair, perfumes and powder with chemicals, aluminium and plastic utensils, ACs and coolers.
- Adapt these : honey, _Desi_ Cow _ghee_/milk/curd/_gomutra_, _gud_, _shakkar_, _khand_, rock/black salt, raw/filtered oil for cooking and as hair oil, naturally grown food, sleeping around 10pm, washing your eyes and mouth regularly.
- **Use natural remedies for illness and fever**. The most common can be found in your kitchen and your surroundings example - _haldi_, _ginger_, _garlic_ ,_onion_, cloves, lemon, honey, _tulsi_, black pepper, fenugreek, _mishri_, _neem_, _giloy_, alovera etc.
